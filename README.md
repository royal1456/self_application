# self_application-low-to-high-resolution-copier
my first python code for extreme help,a simple file copier as per from 2 directories matching as per names
all it does is copy files from one directory to another>>>
but it helps me in a way to select preview or low resolution photos (typically client side ,which are to be further opertaor) which are being selected but in high resolution(typically
which is available to manager or company)>>>
